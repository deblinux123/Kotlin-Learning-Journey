# 📚 Kotlin Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Kotlin Learning Journey** 🚀
I’m starting to learn **Kotlin** step by step, organizing my progress by **weeks** and **months**. This repository will track my learning, practice exercises, and mini-projects as I go along.

---

## 🗓️ Learning Plan

### 📅 Weekly Goals

* **Week 1** → Learn basics (syntax, variables, data types, input/output)
* **Week 2** → Control flow (if, when, loops)
* **Week 3** → Functions & Null Safety
* **Week 4** → Object-Oriented Kotlin (classes, objects, inheritance)

### 📆 Monthly Goals

* **Month 1** → Kotlin fundamentals (syntax + OOP basics)
* **Month 2** → Advanced Kotlin (collections, generics, lambdas, coroutines basics)
* **Month 3** → Android Development with Kotlin
* **Month 4+** → Build projects (apps, CLI tools, libraries)

## ⚡ How I’ll Track Progress

✅ Daily commits (small code snippets or notes)
✅ Weekly summaries (what I learned + challenges faced)
✅ Monthly reflection (progress + mini-project showcase)

---

## 🎯 Goals

* Build a solid foundation in Kotlin
* Use Kotlin for Android Development
* Work on real-world projects
* Document and share my journey for others who want to learn Kotlin

## 🚀 Getting Started (for others following along)

If you want to follow along with my Kotlin learning:

1. Install [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/getting-started.html)
2. Use [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or [VS Code with Kotlin plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fwcd.kotlin)
3. Clone this repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/kotlin-learning-journey.git
   cd kotlin-learning-journey
   ```
4. Run a Kotlin file:

   ```bash
   kotlinc week-01/day-01-hello-kotlin.kt -include-runtime -d hello.jar
   java -jar hello.jar
   ```

## 💡 Inspiration

I believe **consistency beats intensity**.
Even if I learn a **little bit daily**, over months it will add up to **big progress**.
